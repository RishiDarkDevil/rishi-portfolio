subtitle: "I used to say, 'If you ever come to my house, my mother's love for your presence would far surpass mine.' My mother was truly the heart of our home, and the embodiment of love and warmth. She was a masterful cook, a gifted artist, a skilled seamstress, and a poet at heart. She was my first and most beloved teacher, guiding me through every step of my journey with a gentle hand. She took me to karate and drawing lessons, carried my school bag, and always had a warm meal waiting for me. She was my rock, always there to comfort and care for me when I was sick, and to celebrate my successes with more joy than I could ever muster. She taught me the true meaning of happiness, showing me that it is not found in material possessions, but in the love and laughter shared with loved ones."
summary: "Mom taught me simplicity."

As promised I am back with a new problem from the collection. For new readers, I have recently started a new series where I bring interesting probability puzzles and their solutions to present some revealing aspect of our thought process — something which I really wanted when I learnt about Probability (someone who can walk me through each step and guide why some way of thinking was wrong). You can also contribute your problems or solutions to this series, by reaching me out on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram or Email.

The problem goes like this…<br>
**Two gamblers are playing a coin toss game. Gambler A has (n + 1) fair coins; B has n fair coins. What is the probability that A will have more heads than B if both flip all their coins?**

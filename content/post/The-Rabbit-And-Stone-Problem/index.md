I have this friend of mine, who constantly pokes me to solve interesting puzzles. He sometimes even rings me up, just to look at the problem he sent :P This is one of those problems, that I enjoyed working on. It requires understanding of basic probability theory, counting and some time to stick to a problem that interests you.

The problem goes like this… <br>
**There are 7 stones in a row labelled 1 to 7 from left to right. A rabbit starts at stone 1 and on each turn hops to a new stone that they haven’t visited yet. After visiting all the stones, what is the probability the rabbit made exactly one leftwards jump?**

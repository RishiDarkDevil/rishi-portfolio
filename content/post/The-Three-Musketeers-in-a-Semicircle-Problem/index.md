I came across this interesting problem on which my seniors were brainstorming late at night. It requires a bit knowledge of continuous random variables in probability and little bit visualization capability.

The problem goes like this… <br>
**There are three musketeers who stand on a circle randomly, which follows Uniform(0, 2πr) independently where r is the radius of the circle. They can help each other if they are close enough in case of a sudden attack by the enemies. Find the probability of them lying on the same semicircle.**

> All models are wrong, but some are useful

The two fundamental pillars of supervised statistical learning — Regression and Classification. Simple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression is how many of us have started our journey in Statistics and Data Science. A long-standing debate still prevails on why is Logistic Regression a Classification Model instead of a Regression Model?

Here we revisit Logistic Regression from an intuitive perspective along with statistical rigor. We will briefly touch up on the concepts behind Generalized Linear Model along with an optional section on Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) to fit these models.

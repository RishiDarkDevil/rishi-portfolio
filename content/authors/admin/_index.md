<p>My research interests broadly revolve around Quantum Computing, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am presently working towards Graph-Theoretic Transpilation Methods for Deployment of Quantum Circuits on NISQ Hardware. Recently, I have developed deep interest in Quant Trading, Research and Market Microstructure Modelling.</p>

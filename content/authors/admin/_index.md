<p>I am a senior pursuing my undergraduate degree in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. Currently, I am working with <a href="http://amitavadas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Amitava Das</a> at the <a href="https://aiisc.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Institute, University of South Carolina.</a></p> At ISI Kolkata, I am the Event Head for the Annual DataFest Challenge and drive many AI related group discussions.

<p>My research interests broadly revolve around Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I have led several projects in the field of Multi-Modal Learning, AI Fairness and Computational Neuroscience during the last couple of years. I am currently working towards pushing frontiers of object detection and generating richer joint embeddings. Reach out if you are interested in my research or would like to discuss any ideas.</p>

<p><span style="color:orange; style:bold;"><strong>I am looking for Summer 2023 Internship Opportunities.</strong></span></p>

<p>I love to travel, listen to songs and cook. I enjoy writing about my experiences and ideas on <a href="https://medium.com/@rishidarkdevil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>.</p>
